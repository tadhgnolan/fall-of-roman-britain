# Fall of Roman Britain

 - Fall of Roaman Britain is a multiple choice text based game that pays tribute to the classic choose your own adventure books such as "Space Patrol", "The Deadly Shadow" and "The Cave of Time", as well as some slight reference to older more complex text adventure games such as "Zork".  

 - The user will either be of the age group familiar with these books and may find some nostalgia in the reference present or completely new to the convention and find some novelty within it. They should expect to find a story with multiple choices for both direction and action, as per the orignal inspiration. Certain choices will have consequences at the end of the game.
