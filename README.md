## Users

- The user will either be of the age group familiar with these books and may find some nostalgia in the reference present or completely new to the convention and find some novelty within it. They should expect to find a story with multiple choices for both direction and action, as per the orignal inspiration. Certain choices will have consequences at the end of the game.
